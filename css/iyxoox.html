            Honestly you make me so angry the way you dont give two shits about what happens to me. If you were able to access your empathy and your feminine side, youd be a much better father, the way my mom tries to pick up your slack all the time. But honestly your so afraid of looking gay or like a bitch that it makes you bad at being a dad.

I know you never wanted a single kid with my mom. When i was in school they would say, unless youre ready to have a kid you should keep your dick in your pants.

I guess you shouldve kept your dick in your pants pa.

You gave me so much fucked up advice. And im the idiot who never told you that you dont mean anything to me just because you knocked up my mom.

I told you you werent my father because you were never there and you were treating me like shit for waking up late in the day, when i actually used to work my ass off in school.

You may not care but i was with a girl i really loved when you came. You made me look like a bitch to her because of how you treates me and she dumped my ass. I tried to get you to meet my next gf who i was going to marry, again you barely give a shit unless i listen to your radio show.

You know its weird, youre needier and more petty than any chick ive evwr dated. I always thought i needes you around for a male role model, but tbh maybe youre the reason im as emotional and needy as i am, and you not being and me just having this idea of you (thats stronger than you really are) has actually been much better for me than anything you or your psycho family could ever do for me.

I never needed money from you, i never needed anything but your approval. But now i see youre approval doesnt exist, youre not capable of giving it, so why should it be worth anything to me? Because youre my father? Because you constantly disrespect my mother? Because you tell me about fucking her? Because you tell me about fucking kids when you were a kid?

Dude honestly you have gone out of your way to try and ruin me because i didnt take your name, that youre honestly a horrible person. My mom needs me more tgab you ever will, and the fact that you dont care about leaving me strong for her.

You dont love me, you dont consider me part of your family, and thats your problem because im your son whether i like it or not. Youre the one who gets to pretend you dont have a son.

So go ahead, have your emotions, be a petty woman, and dont talk to me ever again unless you  have an apology for my mother and i ready.

        I also think they were all depending on me not wanting to say all that stuff out loudI just realized manny and his friends spread all that bullahit because when i got to louisiana i didnt send mushrooms. I got sketched out by the mail system especially from louisiana and considering who i was with. The girl i was living with ended up turning on me when she got tired of me (literally pushed me out of the house we were living in because she got tired of me and was lying about basically everything to me) so tbh im glad i didnt send stuff because i guarantee those girls wouldve had everybodys addrrsses and phone numbers and ids because there were no boundaries. It was different with l#amaya who wasnt gonna turn on her own people, but in louisiana anybody i did business with wouldve been in danger bc once i got over there i started buying weed from someone who put a target on my back for growing mushrooms and bc of me and my gf becoming friends with his gf at the time. He her and my ex, and a bunch of their friends started trying to destroy me bc of how i just moved out and carried on with my life. It took me years to realize that she turned on me because i at e my own mushrooms instead of "not getting high on my own supply" which was crazy bc i didnt do mushrooms for a long ass time while i was moving so i couls stabilize myself and the one time i do some, well our room mates mother came into our house, told me i was taking advantage of these girls (she had just moved in and i think we got into a thing about dishes one day because i went to sleep with a cold pot of rice on the stove and she came and lectured me about bacteria how bacteria grows)

 But when you came to visit it had been so long i didnt even think about sending them back with you. But thats the whole reason all these people started talking shit, because i didnt send mushrooms. Well, that was the reason they were ready to believe whatever the people who turned on me in louisiana would say. And its because they found other people and other drugs to do. And because enas couldnt let her father find out i wss living with her. Which i never shouldve agreed to. I wish id thought about that but i didnt.

Anyway i guess when i was a kid i was hard for me to realize any of this because i guess i just believed most people were just nice, but as ive grown ive learned better than that. Some of this stuff is still just clicking for me. But i think mannys always kinda wanted to see me fuck myself up. Idk i get that i used to just trust people for nothing, but i didnt do any of the fucked up shit they said i did, and i definitely never sought to do anything wrong tbh, and its actually completely disillusioning realizing how many people i trusted that were lying to me.

Idk sorry to spill all of this, but it really fucked me up that people would believe all this stuff about me or how many people turned out never even really cared about me or liked me or whatever, not to mention how much its affected my personal life, but now it makes sense now considering most of these people were listrning to manny and manny probably got pissed off for this stupid ass reason.

Plus when i was in house of pain they literally staged an orgy to try and frame me for rape. Idk why i didnt leave right then, i dont think i understood that it was fake at the time. I thought she really thought i tried to do something to her. But no she came over they got drunk, they started fucking, they invited me in, she freaked out. And started screaming out "daddy daddy no daddy please" 

And im pretty positive thats because when alana and i started dating a week before i was kinda tripping out and i said to her "i wanna be your daddy" 

Cringiest shit i have ever said but i guess i was fucked up by all the shit that happened with me and amaya. In some weird way i guess i was saying i wanted to take care of her, which i did, but i guess i just thought she was into that and  it just slipped out but i shouldve known better and known that still be making fun of that 30 years later. I just liked her and i thought she was pretty and i guess i got nervous and stopped thinking. 

But this shit has been fucking me up for years. And i just wanna put it behind me tbh.
